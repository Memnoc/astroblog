  <h2>Just me stuff</h2>
  <p>
    Myb name is Matteo and I am softwre engineer specialized in front-end
    frameworks. My current obsession is React, but that's gonna change soon :D I
    am old enough to know what a VHS cassette player is and also to appreciate
    90's hits!
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>My academic education</h2>
  <p>
    I have a Master's degree in linguistics and I speak around six languages,
    natural ones, that is (but talk to me in English or Italian).
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>My programming journey</h2>
  <p>
    I love Java and I learned quite a bit of it for Android development, did a
    bit of Kotlin too and then switched to JavaScript with a classic frontend
    stack. I am now using React for my main projects, but this particular blog
    was built using Astro, and I am very much enjoing the experience so far! My
    passion for software started in the XDA developer community where I started
    porting Mobile OS from newer phones to older ones - HTC was my main target
    at the time, but then I quicly discovered the existence of CyanogenMod and
    its open source community, and tha changed my life.

  <h2>Linux Linux Linux</h2>
  <p>
    I work for big tech so I have to use macOS, and I really like it, but my
    passion and love goes to Linux. This blog was developed on Arch (BTW) and I
    loved every second of it.
