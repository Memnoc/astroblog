Zettelkasten is a a storage/archiving system developed by the social scientist Niklas Lohmann to enhance productivity and better retain knowledge.

Originally based entirely on paper, the system started as a slip-box where the scientis would store fleeting notes of various topics.
With time, he perfected the system and streamlined it into some fundamentals pillars:

 - fleeting notes
 - literature notes
 - permanent notes

These notes are card types and they all follow certain rules.

**Fleeting notes**

Random thougts, media consumption (videos, articles, tv shows, etc.), conversations, studies, books, etc.

**Literature notes**

A summary of our understanding of the sources we have consumed in the fleeting notes. It's important not to copy the source, but re-elaborating with your own understanding

**Permanent notes**

This is where the consolidation of the two previous phases happens, and the output gets close to a final one, that could for example mean the publication of an article or a book or a video, etc.

I felt like a piece was missing, at least for me and at least for now, so I added a further step to keep track of results and outputs.

**Finis Effectus**

It's latin for "final result" and it's meant to be an index of all the materials published and shared with the rest of the world. I know, it sounds like an Harry Potter potion but in reality, it's a great way to keep track of what you do with your studies.

One fundamental advantage of this system is the fact that you can hyperlink each card in a circular loop. 
Why is this useful, you ask? 
Good questions, one I had myself, and this is why - the act of linking cards reveals the knowledge storing pattern of your brain, otherwise hidden. 

Instead of forcing your mind to create artifical containers and hoping the knowledge would magically and spontaneously flow into them, you allow the mere act of consuming and organizing knowledge to be the main architect and teach you the way.
You will then find out that in doing so, recalling the knowledge will feel as natural as the act of remembering something, and so retaining that knowledge is now also easier and more natural.

Here is an example of the linking workflow:

**Fleeting note** *links to ->* **Literature note** *links to ->* **Permanent note ***links back to ->* **Fleeting note and permanent note**

As you can see, this system interconnects ideas to one another, bi-directionally, so that you always know where an idea came from and observe its development and correct its patterns, if needed.

I also want to add another powerful act to this process, which is referencing the knowledge. In theory or by tradition, there should be a media folder or something similar to store this type of information, but in practice, I prefere using a template where I always link the video, article or book (or all of them) I am writing about and/or took my idea from.

This is perhaps the most powerful way to remember things you have watched, and really memorising the content. I find myself coming back to old notes and still remembering the IN's and OUT's of these videos and articles.

Lastly, I am being purposely general  about the details of my implementation, as I am still uncertain about some aspects of it, more related to tooling rather than methodology; when I have that part squarted out, I will write a more detailed how to.
